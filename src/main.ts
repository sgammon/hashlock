 * interpret the file contents into one `HashFileContent` record per entry in the hash file. This method is designed to
 * tolerate errors while reading or decoding the hash file; these are propagated upward as `HashVerifyErr` exceptions.
 *
 * This method parses the hash file contents and will error aggressively if the contents do not match an expected
 * format. There are two supported variants of the format:
 *
 * 1) Hash files inline in the file, between 1 and N, like:
 *
 * **somefile.txt**:
 * ```text
 * (content)
 * ```
 *
 * **some-hash-file.txt.md5**:
 * ```text
 * 1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef  somefile.txt
 * 1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef  some/other/file.txt
 * ```
 *
 * In this mode, the hash file is expected to contain one hash per line, with the hash and the subject separated by
 * whitespace (any whitespace of any amount is fine). The subject is expected to be a relative path to the hash file, or
 * to be a peer file within the same directory if no path is present.
 *
 * The hash file filename does not need to match anything in particular in this mode. Mode 1 is the default mode; mode 2
 * (described below) only kicks in if no file is specified at all.
 *
 * 2) Hash files named alongside their subject, with no file specified, like:
 *
 * * **somefile.txt**:
 * ```text
 * (content)
 * ```
 *
 * **somefile.txt.md5**:
 * ```text
 * 1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
 * ```
 *
 * There are additional restrictions in this mode: (1) it only functions as a fallback to mode #1; (2) the hash file
 * can only list one hash (any additional non-blank lines cause an error), and (3) the hash file must be named after
 * the subject file, and must be in the same directory as the subject file.
 *
 * @param file Absolute and normalized path to a hash file
 * @returns Array of assertions specified within the hash file; one per subject/hash pair
